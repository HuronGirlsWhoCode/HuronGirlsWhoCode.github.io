    <h1>Why We Started GWC</h1>
    <p>We started Huron Girls Who Code to create the community we felt was missing. Too often, we found ourselves sitting in classrooms and competitions with hardly any other girls. It could be isolating and discouraging, and we wished for peers who shared our curiosity for computer science. With this club, we hope to build the welcoming space we always wanted<span>&mdash;</span>a place where anyone interested in coding can learn, experiment, and grow together, no matter their experience.</p>

        <h3 class="board-position-text">Co-President</h3>
        <p class="bio-text">Paavani is a junior at Huron and has been coding since 4th grade. She has taken AP CSA and can code in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and C++ (although C++ is her favorite). She also competes in USACO and ACSL. In her free time, she loves solving puzzles, listening to music, and eating anything chocolate.</p>

        <h3 class="board-position-text">Co-President</h3>
        <p class="bio-text">Bhaavna is a senior at Huron who has taken almost all of the Computer Science classes offered at school. She can code in Java, HTML/CSS, and Python, and has also picked up some useful cybersecurity skills along the way. When she’s not coding, she loves to crochet, read, and spend time with her family. She is also a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and the movie Ella Enchanted!</p>
